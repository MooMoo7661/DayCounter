This mod tracks days passed, and creates a little popup at the start of each day.
The data is saved per-world, meaning each world keeps track of the days passed individually.

! THIS DOES NOT COUNT DAYS PASSED WHEN THE MOD WAS NOT ENABLED !
That is impossible, since terraria doesn't track days either, so there is no possible way to get days passed before / when the mod isn't enabled.

It is configurable for the background color, text color, and popup time / noise.

It works in multiplayer, and should have no issues syncing data.
It also works for subworlds, singleplayer, and probably any other scenario.

This mod is not client sided, because it relies on sending / recieving data from the server, and syncing between connected players.
In the future, I will make it have an option to be client sided, but that means it will not grab the right day count when joining a server, and will instead start at 0.

MOD COMMANDS:
/day - displays the current day
/preview - triggers the notification. Useful for customization with the config
/resetday - sets the day counter to 1
/setday - takes in one solid number, and sets the day counter
